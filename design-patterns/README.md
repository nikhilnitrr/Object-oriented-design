# Most commonly used design patterns have been implemented in python programming language
(For detailed explanation of each design pattern , refer : https://nikhilchandrakar.hashnode.dev/)
## Singleton design pattern :
    - Singleton design pattern is one of the most commonly used design patterns. We use singleton design pattern when we need only one instance of a class.
    - For example : Logger, Configuration manager, Parking station, Chess-Board
## Thread safe singleton design pattern :
    - Singleton design pattern that ensures that even if multiple threads are running, only one instance is created.
## Strategy design pattern :
    - Strategy design pattern can be defined as a design pattern that defines a family of algorithms and put them into separate classes so that they can be changed at run-time.
